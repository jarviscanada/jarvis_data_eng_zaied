      "description": "My research field was Image Processing and Computer vision. Noises affect images in an unpredictable way. Specifically, my research was to design an algorithm that will efficiently remove those noises. BM3D was one of the state-of-the-arts of such algorithms. As my M.Sc. thesis, I developed an algorithm which works on top of BM3D and produced almost 40% improved results for all images and all noise levels. The publication title was \"Optimizing the usage of 2D and 3D transformations to improve the BM3D image denoising algorithm.\" The implemented final codebase was in C++. Most of the Experiments were done in Matlab and Python. Exception handling and efficient memory usage were kept in mind during the implementation. The efficient usage of several STL data structures had been done as well. Achieving this target gave me experience on how to manage a large codebase and add features compatible with it in a time and memory-efficient way",

White lesions are usually seen in the MRI images of MS patients and accurate differentiation is needed between actual lesion areas and other white areas which can occur for various reasons. Developed an algorithm that can identify the actual lesion and inpaints the extraneous ones. Published the algorithm in 2016 International Conference on Medical Engineering, Health Informatics, and Technology (Meditec). The publication title was \"Inpainting multiple sclerosis lesions for improving registration performance with brain atlas\" The implemented codebase was in Matlab and C++. Several open-source brain imaging tools and data formats were used. Collaborated with a remote team in this project.",

This app itself is also dockerized. Springboot annotations were used to facilitate the IoC container creation, bean creation, and Dependency Injection. Springboot embedded Tomcat server serves as a web servlet API implementation to handle HTTP requests. Repository pattern was used as the data layer and IEX API was used as the market data provider API.PostMan and Swagger were used extensively to test the app end-points.
