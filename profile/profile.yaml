summary: "Self-motivated problem-solver and strong collaborator who always strives for an innovative and most suitable solution. 
I have started working as a Jarvis consultant after the completion of my Master's degree in Computer Science (Research-Based). 
Apart from my Master's research project, I have collaborated with several labs to provide software solutions during my master's. 
These experiences grew interest and confidence inside me to contribute to the data engineering industry. 
Practicing programming problem-solving is one of my hobbies alongside reading books on different topics."

    description: "Developed a Bash and PostgreSQL based cluster monitoring agent 
    for distributed systems. The Node machines send continuous 
    hardware usage and hardware specification data which is 
    monitored and persisted by the server machine in a PostgreSQL 
    database. The PostgreSQL database instance was hosted by a 
    docker container. The container was created based on the 
    PostgreSQL base image from the docker registry. Maven was 
    used to managing dependencies."
  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      - "Twitter App: Developed this Java-based Maven managed app. 
      This app shows, posts, deletes tweet data 
      using the Twitter API. Efficient exception handling, logging, 
      and testing frameworks were used in these apps. self4j facade 
      and as the implementation log4j was used for the 
      logging purpose whereas the Mockito framework was used 
      for unit testing and Junit 4 was used for Integration testing. 
      MVC architecture was used where the Dao pattern was used for data 
      access and retrieval. Jackson API was used to parse and create 
      JSON objects to POJO objects or vice versa." 
      - "JDBC App: Developed this dockerized Java-based JDBC app that
      interacts with the PostgreSQL database with pure Java and JDBC 
      driver. The PostgreSQL database instance is hosted by a docker 
      container that was created from the PostgreSQL base image."
      - "Grep App: Developed this Java-based command-line-app that 
      recursively traverses directories and subdirectories and 
      perform searching or text-processing."
  - name: "Springboot App"
    git_url: "/springboot"
    description: "Developed this maven packaged springboot managed 
    Java app. This is an MVC architecture driven three-tier 
    Microservice REST API web app which can be consumed by any 
    REST API client or browser. It responses back JSON object. 
    It interacts with market data provider API, extracts stock Market 
    data and shows, updates, deletes, and additionally persists them 
    in a dockerized PostgreSQL database. This app itself is also 
    dockerized. Springboot annotations were used to facilitate 
    the IoC container creation, bean creation, and Dependency 
    Injection. Springboot embedded Tomcat server serves as a 
    web servlet API implementation to handle HTTP requests. 
    Repository pattern was used as the data layer and IEX API 
    was used as the market data provider API.PostMan and Swagger 
    were used extensively to test the app end-points. The 
    decoupling of data and app makes it fault-tolerant."

    description:  "My research field was Image Processing and Computer vision.
    Noises affect images in an unpredictable way. Specifically, my research was
    to design an algorithm that will efficiently remove those noises. BM3D was 
    one of the state-of-the-arts of such algorithms. As my M.Sc. thesis, I
    developed an algorithm which works on top of BM3D and produced almost 40%
    improved results for all images and all noise levels. The publication title 
    was \"Optimizing the usage of 2D and 3D transformations 
    to improve the BM3D image denoising algorithm.\" The implemented 
    final codebase 
    was in C++. Most of the Experiments were done in Matlab and Python. 
    Exception handling and efficient memory usage 
    were kept in mind during the implementation. The efficient usage of 
    several STL data structures had been done as well. Achieving this 
    target gave me experience on how to manage a large codebase and add 
    features compatible with it in a time and memory-efficient way"
  - name: "Automated Data Extraction from OMR using Python and OpenCV"
    git_url:
    description: "Developed automated software for extracting student data
    from OMR. It can also find out attained marks from the OMR sheet.
    Python offers a convenient ecosystem for Image processing related tasks, used 
    Python and OpenCV to develop the software. Worked under this project 
    assigned by the Bangladesh Education Ministry."
  - name: "MRI Image Inpainting Software using NIFTI and Matlab"
    git_url:
    description: "Multiple sclerosis is a well-known disease that can be diagnosed by MRI images. White lesions are usually seen 
    in the MRI images of MS patients and accurate differentiation is needed between actual lesion areas and other white areas 
    which can occur for various reasons. Developed an algorithm that can identify the actual lesion and inpaints the extraneous ones.
    Published the algorithm in 2016 International Conference on Medical Engineering, Health 
    Informatics, and Technology (Meditec).
    The publication title was \"Inpainting multiple sclerosis lesions for improving registration performance with brain atlas\" The implemented 
    codebase was in Matlab and C++. Several open-source brain imaging tools 
    and data formats were used. Collaborated with a remote team in this 
    project."

    duration: "September,2019-January,2020"
    description:  "Mentored the current lab students and collaborated with 
    labs to deliver an automation software solution. It was a medical 
    imaging software that provides an efficient way to track and count 
    blood cells from dyed brain images of rats. The solution was adaptive 
    with different dyes and several image scenarios and distractions. The 
    solution was written in C++ and iopng library was used to read and write 
    images to reduce latency. However, the solution was packaged as a Mex 
    file to be invoked from Matlab for user convenience. This experience 
    grew leadership and increased my collaboration abilities with clients"

    company: "Western University"
    duration: "September,2017-August,2019"
    description:  "Designed and implemented an algorithm to improve image 
    processing (denoising) performance which was my master's research topic. 
    BM3D is the state-of-the-art algorithm for image denoising. My proposed 
    algorithm works on top of BM3D and improves the overall denoising 
    performance. The proposed algorithm beat the performance of BM3D 
    significantly in all noise levels and varieties of images. The 
    codebase was written in C++. To reduce the time complexity approaches 
    like Dynamic programming was used while designing and low latency C 
    libraries like iopng were used to read and write the image. Designing 
    and implementing algorithms with minimal supervision made me confident 
    to work individually."
